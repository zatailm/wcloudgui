This coffee shop is absolutely amazing! The coffee is rich and flavorful, and the ambiance is perfect.
The baristas here are so friendly and skilled. My latte was beautifully crafted and tasted incredible!
I love the cozy atmosphere and the soft background music. It’s the perfect place to relax or get some work done.
Their cold brew is one of the best I’ve ever had! Refreshing, smooth, and not too bitter.
Super fast service and great quality coffee! I always stop by before heading to work.
The pastries here are delicious! The croissants are flaky, and the muffins are so fresh.
Such a great vibe! The interior design is beautiful, and the natural lighting makes it a great spot for photos.
The cappuccino was perfectly balanced, and the foam was so creamy. I’ll definitely be coming back!
This place always serves high-quality coffee with a smile. Highly recommend for coffee lovers!
Affordable prices for such premium quality! Definitely one of the best coffee spots in town.
The barista was not friendly at all and didn’t even greet customers. I felt ignored while ordering.
The coffee here is overpriced for such an average taste. There are many other places with better coffee at a lower price.
The tables were dirty and covered in coffee stains, it seems like they are never properly cleaned. Very uncomfortable to sit for long.
I had to wait more than 30 minutes just for a cup of coffee, even though the café wasn’t crowded.
The espresso was too bitter and acidic, it seems like the brewing technique was off.
The music was too loud, making it hard to have a conversation or work peacefully.
The Wifi was extremely slow and kept disconnecting. Not a good place for working or studying.
I ordered a cappuccino but got a latte instead. When I complained, they refused to replace my drink.
It’s always crowded, and there’s no clear queue system. It’s hard to find a seat.
I could tell the coffee wasn’t made with fresh beans. It tasted flat and lacked aroma.
